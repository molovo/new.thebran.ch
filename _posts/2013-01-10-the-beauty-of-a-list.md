Like any person, we tend to get distracted by various things in life: TV, social activities, those good old social network sites which we love. Like any other person I am a sucker for a reason to procrastinate or distract myself from the serious parts of my day.

As a Gemini, I have a tendency to make lists, timetables and any kind of organised, written, colour-coded chart... and not stick to them! Nope. I used to spend hours making lists of how I'm going to make my life 'more improved' and never stick to them out of laziness. Actually, I would not say laziness but more gaining the motivation to do something. To be able to make one do something is a lot harder than saying 'I am going to do it', and recently since going into my last year of University I have felt a definite drop in motivational levels.

University for me has always been a dream, similar to being able to touch the clouds and taste them without it disappearing into nothing. As a child I have grown up in a very working class background, where both parents never went to University and took on working class jobs. My father, who is borderline illiterate, was a plasterer for the duration of his working life; whereas my mother worked in cosmetics and hairdressing. I have always been one of those children who needed to plan life down to every precise move (which also included a decision at the tender age of 13 that I WAS to attend University) and from it I have developed a need to be in control of certain situations. However, University (as much as it is a god-send) has brought to my attention issues which became hard to control like money and an overload of assignments.

So for someone who needs control in her life this became a nightmare! Yet it wasn't until I watched an episode of the hit TV program 'My Name is Earl' that something clicked. In the first episode it showed the main character Earl having an epiphany and deciding to make a list of all the things he had done wrong, which he must fix to become a better person. Like someone had flicked a switch I became myself again and said to myself 'You need to sort yourself out'.

I decided to make a list but of all the things I needed to sort in my life, including everything I had put off or pushed aside. In my head the debts were going to disappear, I was to tackle the workload and I was going to realise my dream and save the money to travel round Europe. So with that, I started my list on January 1st of this year and, so far so good! I am slowly yet steadily organising myself, while tackling all the things that have scared me in the past.

The trick I find is to keep telling yourself you are going to be fine, and to have that self-confidence is the most important thing. The flick of a switch may work in mysterious ways but when it hits you there is no going back!
