I'm inspired by the idea that everything is connected. I think this is because of my affinity for teaching and all the different capacities in which I've done that, and I've found that it is necessary to be interested in and be able to talk to people from all walks of life. So this morning, I was able to make an interesting connection between creating concoctions in the kitchen and how people have come to know what we now know.

Lately I've been throwing healthy ingredients together in a blender and eagerly waiting to try the mixed, delicious mess I have created. When I did that today, and was surprised that what I made tasted good, I thought, This is what it must have been like, when people were discovering the world for the first time. How were they supposed to know what foods to eat, what not to eat? Where to go, not to go? Who to be with, who to stay away from? It all derived from not only this process, but a willingness to experiment, and perhaps, be experimented on. I think this means that cultivating fearlessness was a large part of our lives at one point, consistently diving into the unknown, discovering how to live. So what does this mean for now?

To understand that there is no need to stop from experimenting or to take off our curiosity hats. We don't know everything, we never will. But a desire for exploration, discovery, and adventure--that is what will keep us moving forward, with new eyes.
