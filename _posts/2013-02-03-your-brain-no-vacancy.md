Much of my inspiration derives from the stories, images and interactions that stick with me. This image has stuck with me since I read it. In answer to a question for The Paris Review Interviews, Ernest Hemingway had this to say about intellectual training for a would-be writer:

> Let's say that he should go out and hang himself because he finds that writing well is impossibly difficult. Then he should be cut down without mercy and forced by his own self to write as well as he can for the rest of his life. At least he will have the story of the hanging to commence with.

Note: It’s not the hanging that’s done without mercy, but the cutting down. It’s the being “forced by his own self to write as well as he can” that becomes the torture.

Now that we’re all in a deep dark place, let me bring some light in.

Creative minds are tortured by the anxiety that comes from the size of big ideas. And big ideas can’t progress in brain spaces that are constipated by the innate 21st century obligation of “taking it all in”. Inspiration thrives when we make room for the big ideas. When we take all of the stories, images and interactions we've absorbed and give them enough space to mingle and rough each other up a bit.

Now, another metaphor: If inspiration is a lighting bolt, then you should stand in a big, open field for it to strike you — or on the top of a tall building with a metal rod, but I said I would bring some light into this thing, so let’s stick with the field imagery.

My open field is the train. Once I’ve gotten my tea and barely slipped through the doors of the 7:48 to Union Station, I find a seat on the Red Line. For a little over an hour I’m in this helpless place where I don’t worry about the time or traffic. Within this temporary reprieve from the weight of obligation, my mind is loose and unburdened. No, I can’t hop on the train every time I need inspiration, but I try to emulate that same freedom when I’m creating — coming as close as I can to a truly clear head.

While they don’t discount it, most successful artists and innovators will agree that inspiration is not a reliable force for creativity. It’s merely the result of the right ideas crossing paths at the right time. I’m proposing that there’s always an influx of "right ideas", you’ve just got to make sure it’s at the right time.

Now, here’s where I risk discounting everything I’ve said so far.

You can take advice from all of the greats (even Mr. Hemingway), but inspiration is subjective. Your recipe for revelation won’t be the same as theirs. So, a great place to start is right here. It’s articulating your own thoughts on inspiration and living by them. It’s cutting yourself down from the noose and forcing your best hand. It’s *finding your open field*.
