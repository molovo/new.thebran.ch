Those of you who haven't looked out the window today, hands up.

<small>*If you really raised your hand up, please do yourself a favour and go for a little walk. It's unhealthy to shut yourself in.*</small>

Yeah, we all - those who kept their hands down, at least - have those absent-minded moments when we contemplate outside.

It might be a clich√©, or even simply pretentious, but nothing keeps me more amazed and inspired than the weather. Weather seems almost humane. It has its own moods, quirks and habits. The only difference is how powerful it can be. Weather conveys a strong message. Think otherwise? Try being happy on a gloomy dark day.

I tend to find inspiration in *new* things, be it a new framework for programming, a new recipe I can try out in kitchen or a new videogame (who doesn't love them?). Unless you are browsing internet from a submarine or an underground base, I recommend you to take a look at your landscape. There's always something new out there!

Clouds congesting; Trees bending under heavy, cold wind; Sun faintly shining behind a thick gray film; Blue sky tainted by a single smoke trail. There's a reason painters like to go out with their tools of trade, you know.

Observing your local sky can yield several benefits to you and your mind.

First of all, it can keep you calm. Deadlines are creeping near? Well, nature doesn't give a damn and actually, neither should you. Getting down to work with a proper attitude and keeping yourself from rushing things will generally give you the same result (work being finished before deadline), although you'll be far less worn out afterwards.

Secondly, it helps your eyes. When using computers, we're pretty much chaotic and our eyes jump from one point to another. Watching clouds can keep you both focused *and* at ease, which calms you down even further.

Last but not least, *please go and find your own reasons*. Inspiration surely will follow.
