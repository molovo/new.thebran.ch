> One good thing about music: When it hits you, you feel no pain. <cite>Bob Marley</cite>

One of the things that sets apart, alters and affects my day is what I listen to throughout the time between I wake up and go to sleep. The first song I play in the morning can drastically change the outcome of my mood and workflow for the whole day. Sometimes I play a song which keeps me smiling all day and makes me productive, but sometimes when you wake up on the wrong side of the bed it’s all too easy to put on some Smiths or Morrissey, listen to his depressing tones, and just feel plain sorry for yourself.

I find that how creative and inspired I am about an activity or a project is usually down to the flow and mood of my music playing in the background. I’m a religious user of Spotify, and have playlists for every occasion. So how does music affect your mood? Music helps you become inspired, relaxed or even sleepy, but on the other hand it can also make you drive faster on the motorway, take a reckless decision or even give up altogether.

Songs can give you the get up and go you really need, and how many of you can say that you don’t listen to at least some form of music throughout the day. It's universal and is a beautiful art form. Everyone has been in the situation where you have some sort of tedious task or project to complete which you truly have no drive for. I often find that playing songs in the background really puts me into work mode and time often flies by with me barely remembering what the problem or the task even was.

In conclusion, choose what music you play carefully, and try to pick a playlist which is relevant to the tasks throughout your day, and explore.

Always explore.
