That video. That video says it all. That video tells you why I get up in the morning. That video is the reason I'm giving up a secure, well paying job to pursue a career as a freelancer. That video is the reason I work 90-hour weeks and don't feel tired. That video is the first thing I show to someone who tells me they're not sure what they want to do with their life.

Had I not seen that video, web design would still be nothing more than a hobby for me. After seeing that video, I finally managed to find the courage to make the jump, and do what *I* wanted to do with my life. I received little support, and was called an idiot, openly and to my face, for pursuing a risky career when I seemed settled already. But I have no regrets whatsoever.

Now, I listen to those words at least once a week, without fail, and let Mr Watts remind me that I'm doing a job I love, however difficult it can be at times, and that above all else, my work makes me happy.

Alan Watts put into words something which everybody should know, but is too short-sighted to see straight away, myself included. Everybody has something that they enjoy, and he sums up my feelings perfectly with this quote:

> After all, if you do really like what you are doing - it doesn't matter what it is - you can eventually become a master of it. The only way to become a master of something is to be really with it and then you'll be able to get a good fee for whatever it is.

Such wisdom, from a man who I would have loved to have had the chance to meet.

So my best advice to you, is get out there and do something you love. After all, life is for living isn't it?
