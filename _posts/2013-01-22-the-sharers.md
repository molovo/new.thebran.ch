Last week I was lucky to speak at [Talk Web Design](http://www.talkwebdesign.co.uk/) at the University of Greenwich. Ten web professionals spoke on web and work-related topics to a group of students studying web design. I was envious. I wish that I had access to this kind of encouragement and insight when I was studying.

But then I realised that I did. When I was studying for a design education, uninspired by the role models on offer, I found solace in the web. Here there were people giving their knowledge away for free, sharing their thoughts and experiences and rarely expecting anything in return.

These wonderful designers and developers cared about the state of the web and those that use it. They were exemplary of the platform they evangelised. The web was about access for all and they were going to share their skills, enabling as many people as possible to share in, and create with, this platform.

This inspired me. This was the kind of community I wanted to be a part of; this community of sharers.

And today is no different. Every day I see a new resource: a blog post, a code snippet or even just a friendly word of advice passed on by a web professional. They don't care about being the first, or the best, or necessarily even care about getting credit for their effort.

Competition is a joke on the web that I love. We're all working towards two things: a greater web and the best possible user experiences. We share our ways of working and our ways of making money. We share what we think works and where we've learned from our mistakes.

I could never leave the web. Yeah, I could live without search engines and social networks, but I wouldn't want to live without this community and the common website, the online spaces where individuals and groups share their passion. That sense of sharing is the essence of my web.
