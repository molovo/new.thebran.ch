<p>That video. That video says it all. That video tells you why I get up in the morning. That video is the reason I’m giving up a secure, well paying job to pursue a career as a freelancer. That video is the reason I work 90-hour weeks and don’t feel tired. That video is the first thing I show to someone who tells me they’re not sure what they want to do with their life.</p>

<p>Had I not seen that video, web design would still be nothing more than a hobby for me. After seeing that video, I finally managed to find the courage to make the jump, and do what <em>I</em> wanted to do with my life. I received little support, and was called an idiot, openly and to my face, for pursuing a risky career when I seemed settled already. But I have no regrets whatsoever.</p>

<p>Now, I listen to those words at least once a week, without fail, and let Mr Watts remind me that I’m doing a job I love, however difficult it can be at times, and that above all else, my work makes me happy.</p>

<p>Alan Watts put into words something which everybody should know, but is too short-sighted to see straight away, myself included. Everybody has something that they enjoy, and he sums up my feelings perfectly with this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After all, if you do really like what you are doing - it doesn’t matter what it is - you can eventually become a master of it. The only way to become a master of something is to be really with it and then you’ll be able to get a good fee for whatever it is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such wisdom, from a man who I would have loved to have had the chance to meet.</p>

<p>So my best advice to you, is get out there and do something you love. After all, life is for living isn’t it?</p>
