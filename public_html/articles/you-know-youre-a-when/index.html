<p><a href="http://amandapalmer.net/">Amanda Palmer</a> once tweeted a question that went something like;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You know you’re a writer when….?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“You know you’re a writer when your words change how someone feels. Doesn’t matter if it’s a tweet, a book, a blog post or a song.” I replied.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing. The changing how people feel part is how you succeed at anything—and also how you know when you have.</p>

<p>You know you’ve nailed that code when it changes how people feel about the experience they have on the website you built.</p>

<p>You know you’ve created a great brand, app, recipe, or script when people are changed so much by what you’ve done that they can’t help sharing it with their friends.</p>

<p>You know you’re a Dad when making your six-week-old baby smile matters more than anything at that moment.</p>

<p>Being whatever you want to be really is as simple as changing how a single person feels in the moment. And funnily enough that scales, making you a better [whatever you want to be].</p>
