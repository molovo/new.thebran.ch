      <p>Imagine that life as it is - our working week, our hobbies, our wives, husbands, boyfriends and girlfriends; they’re all part of a metaphor of life, represented by a modern medium familiar to many: <em>videogames</em>.</p>

<p>Your skills are your offensive: your spells, weaponry and ammunition.</p>

<p>Promotions and new jobs - that’s moving to the next level.</p>

<p>Lectures, talks, courses and conferences all add to your experience meter; and your portfolio reflects your current level.</p>

<p>I started treating life this way almost a year ago, and it’s had a pretty interesting effect.</p>

<p>Flash back to May 2012: as a full-time employee in the corporate video sector, I felt that I was using the same spell over and over again; stuck on a relatively easy level I didn’t have the motivation to complete and progress to the next level. I was lucky enough to boast a ton of spells in my arsenal: growing up an IT techie who dabbled in graphic design, video editing and 3D (weakened and unexercised skills as they were at the time), I was grateful for the long hours, hunched over my keyboard, teaching myself these skills.</p>

<p>Thing is: if you’ve ever played any game in your lifetime, you’ll know that in order to move to the next level, chances are you’ll face a beast. This beast towers over you, intimidating and terrifying; blocking your pathway into the next level and the rewards beyond. These encounters usually end in a dramatic showdown between the forces of good (you and your hopes, dreams and intents) and evil (your past). In the real world, this could be a particularly long stretch of overtime, an assessment or examination; or even an impossibly difficult client brief.</p>

<p>As a full-time and financially-secure employee, geared toward a frankly terrifying leap into the world of freelance, my beast took the form of a cloaked figure at the door.</p>

<p>Difference was, my beast was holding the door open for me, beckoning me inside.</p>

<p>I wasn’t entirely sure whether the beast was good or evil at the time; not sure whether it beckoned me closer in the unlikely twist in which the shrouded figure turned out to be an encouraging ally, holding open the gateway to a better life; or seemingly more likely the demonic figure, beckoning me into a world filled with unknown horrors - with no way to turn back and return to the comfort and security of the previous level.</p>

<p>I conquered my boss by going for broke and walking boldly through the door without a second look at the cloaked figure. I did everything I could in my first few months - calling favours, visiting agencies, frantic emailing and levelling up my offensive through attending talks, engaging with those in the know, and practicing my spells regularly.</p>

<p>With the one-year mark since I walked through that metaphorical gateway approaching rapidly, I’ve never been prouder to say that I’ve worked harder than I ever have in my life for clients I’d never dreamed I’d work for, met people I never thought I’d meet - and even encountered a few new bosses, too. But with those bosses have come bigger projects, better clients, and a whole new wealth of challenges: which have only increased my experience meter tenfold.</p>

<p>If you take anything away from this bizarre analysis, just remember that next time you reach your own boss; be it an exam, a job opportunity, a new client, or even a change of location - go for it.</p>

<p>After all, the hero always prevails at the end.</p>
