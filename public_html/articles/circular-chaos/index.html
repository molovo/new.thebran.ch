      <p>As a designer, I am inspired by the simple things in life whether it be the pattern of a coffee stain or the logarithmic spiral of the nautilus hemishell. I strive to bring order to chaos and to communicate clear and concise information in the form of visual aesthetics.</p>

<p>What started off as a hobby during college ended up being a career as there is nothing that I find more fulfilling than solving design problems restricted to social boundaries. The great thing about design is that it is broad discipline. That is why I constantly try to challenge myself to learn new techniques related to web, iconography, user interface, 3D, branding and graphic design. As a designer I am never satisfied so I will always seek new ways of improving my ability to adopt the best practices.</p>

<p>I also have a broad range of interests that are not strictly limited to design. Being a hybrid, I also enjoy challenging the logical side of my brain by coding sites from the front to the back end. Solving puzzles from both sides of the spectrum gives me a great sense of accomplishment that can not be replicated by any gaming application.</p>

<p>Although inspiration can be found at a click of a button, I am personally inspired by the giants from within the technology industry. Apple and Google have been at the forefront of pushing the importance of design to the masses. Thanks to the late Steve Jobs, great design is now viewed as a necessity rather than a desirable alternative. It’s important that creators of web applications understand that a user interface sits between the engineer and the user. The role of user experience and design can not be underestimated. Closer to home I find Dribbble to be an invaluable resource for finding design inspiration. I’m an avid user and I can receive tips from anyone regardless of their experience and follow count.</p>

<p>Other things that also inspire me can be perceived through my brand name. CircularChaos was coined from my approach to solving design problems. It represents my philosophy and the core values that I hold. The word ‘circular’ states that a circle, which is unique to any other shape, has no start or end. This can also be said for my ambition and passion. I am constantly learning and adapting to the ever changing design industry. The word ‘chaos’ originates from the chaos theory. This states that even though things may appear random initially, they in fact have a structure to them. The outcome is reliant on its initial conditions. This statement is imperative to designers as we have to seamlessly iterate in order to improve our work. Outside of the design world, there are cases where people assume that we as designers, create solutions just to make it look pretty where in fact, each element is positioned intentionally for intuitiveness. There is a science to design, just like the golden ratio in the Mona Lisa.</p>
