      <p>Clutter; filth; mess. Whatever you choose to call it, we all tend to make our area of work look busy with a myriad of unnecessary items, some of which we hardly use or knew existed.</p>

<p>Growing up we’re always told (mainly by our nagging parents) to keep our environment neat and tidy, and a quick search on the internet reveals those who do are calmer, stress free and have a sense of inner peace. Looks like your mum was onto something after all. But how do you know what and what not to get rid of? Three simple words: The Why Test.</p>

<p>Here’s how it works. Go to your messy desk if you’re not there already, look at each item and ask yourself two questions, ‘why do I need it?’ and ‘how often do I use it?’. If your answer to first question is ‘I don’t’, get rid of it, throw it away, give it to charity or burn it. If you have a good reason for keeping the item then jump to the next question.</p>

<p>How often do I use it? An everyday, weekly or fortnightly item should be kept somewhere easily accessible, on your table top or near your computer. If it’s an item you use every now and again, like a nail clipper, stick it somewhere within reach but out of the way, in a drawer or cupboard maybe. That’s pretty much it.</p>

<p>Now of course there are a few exceptions to these rules. Sentimental items such as pictures of partners and children, presents or the odd decorative item are fine as long as you don’t go overboard.</p>

<p>How often should this test be done? Everyday, once a week, once a month it doesn’t really matter. The objective of the WHY test is to be able to access the regularly used items as quickly as possible; keeping your environment neat is simply a by product. Once you’ve mastered the desk you can move on to other areas like your wardrobe, kitchen, even the desktop on your computer.</p>

<p>So a quick recap. If you don’t know why you need an item or you never use it, bin it. If you use it regularly, keep it close. If you use it every now and again, put it away. Got it?</p>

<p>Now go forth and tidy up.</p>
